* Contentful CLI (only for write access)

Without any changes, this app is connected to a Contentful space with read-only access. To experience the full end-to-end Contentful experience, you need to connect the app to a Contentful space with read-and-write access. This enables you to see how content editing in the Contentful web app works and how content changes propagate to this app.

## Common setup

Could you clean the repo and install the dependencies?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
cd the-example-app.nodejs
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Steps for read-only access

To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm run start: dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and take a look around.
